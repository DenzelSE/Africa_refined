      description: `The Luteal Liberty Project, founded in 2019, aims to empower young girls through reproductive and
        menstrual health education whilst addressing the challenges young women experience as they transition
        through puberty, offering support and resources to help them manage their menstrual and reproductive
        health more effectively.
        
        The concept behind the 'Luteal Liberty' project title stems from the fourth and final phase of the
        menstrual cycle called the 'Luteal' Phase, which occurs after ovulation and before menstruation. During
        this phase, no menstrual fluid exits the body, as the body prepares for a potential pregnancy by
        increasing progesterone levels. Moreover, women experience a break from menstruation and enjoy greater
        freedom of movement. This phase symbolizes a period of preparation, introspection, freedom, and
        empowerment.`,
